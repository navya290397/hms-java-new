1. Add delete booking functionality
Booking Deletion Criteria
Bookings can be deleted if:
The booking has not been checked in yet.
The booking is within the cancellable period (if any cancellation policy applies).
The payment has not been processed or is in a refundable state.
Bookings cannot be deleted if:
The user has already checked in.
The cancellation period has passed (or is outside of the refundable window).
The booking is associated with non-refundable rates (if applicable).
A payment has been processed and is non-refundable.

2. Generate unique booking id instead of auto increment
The unique booking ID is a code that uniquely identifies a specific booking. Instead of relying on an auto-increment field in the database, you can generate this ID using various algorithms or formats. The key requirements include:
Uniqueness: Each booking ID must be unique across the system.
Traceability: The ID should provide enough information for tracking purposes.
Security: The booking ID should not expose sensitive data such as customer information.                                                     

3. Add payment API to do a payment
Implement payment API endpoints to:
Initiate a payment (e.g., create a payment intent).
